# Word Lab
Word Lab is a fun and immersive way to improve vocabulary and communication skills for all ages. 
It enhances spelling, pronunciation, and word comprehension by transforming traditional spelling bee competitions into interactive and educational games. 

## Motivation
The motivation behind Word Lab was to provide an enjoyable and practical learning experience that helps unilingual to multilingual users improve their vocabulary and communication skills.
